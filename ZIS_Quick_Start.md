# TSANet Connect — ZIS Quick Start Guide

**Last updated:** June 2026  
**Time to complete:** ~30 minutes (Steps 1–5); add ~20 minutes for the optional SLA monitor

This guide covers two things:

1. **Connecting ZIS to the TSANet API and deploying the flow bundle** (Steps 1–5) — so ZIS flows can call TSANet without handling auth themselves. The method is **OAuth client credentials (Microsoft Entra)**: ZIS stores a long-lived client credential issued by TSANet and mints/renews short-lived tokens itself. Nothing scheduled, no server, no token-refresh automation ([issue #1](https://github.com/tsanetgit/Zendesk_App/issues/1)).
2. **SLA Breach Monitor** (Steps 6–9) — **optional.** A GitHub Actions job that checks for overdue TSANet acknowledgments and tags Zendesk tickets, triggering email alerts to assignees. TSANet enforces only one SLA (case creation → initial acknowledgment) and does so server-side regardless — the integration is complete without this. Implement it if you want breach alerting inside Zendesk, or skip it and build something more robust with Zendesk's native SLA policies.

> **Shortest path:** if you skip the optional SLA monitor, you need no GitHub repository, no secrets, and no workflow — Steps 1–5 and you're done.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| Zendesk Admin access | Needs API token + ZIS integration management |
| TSANet-issued Entra client | Client ID + secret from TSANet, plus service principal onboarding (contact TSANet with your SP object ID) |
| TSANet API credentials | Same API user as the ZAF app (`api@yourcompany.com`) — only needed for the optional SLA monitor |
| GitHub repository + `gh` CLI | Only for the optional SLA monitor ([gh install](https://cli.github.com/)) |
| ZIS OAuth client | Created in Zendesk Admin Center (see Step 2) |

---

## Architecture Overview

```
ZIS ↔ TSANet connection
│
└── OAuth client credentials (Entra)
      ZIS holds client_id + client_secret
      ZIS mints/renews short-lived tokens itself
      → nothing scheduled, no refresh automation

GitHub Actions — optional add-on
│
└── sla-monitor
      1. POST /v1/login → TSANet JWT
      2. GET OPEN collaboration requests
      3. For each past-deadline case:
           - Search Zendesk for ticket by TSANet token
           - POST tag tsanet_sla_breached (if not already tagged)
           → Zendesk trigger fires → emails ticket assignee
```

---

## Step 1 — Create a Zendesk API Token

1. Go to **Admin Center → Apps and integrations → APIs → Zendesk API**
2. Click **Add API token**
3. Give it a description: `TSANet ZIS`
4. Copy the token — you won't see it again

---

## Step 2 — Create a ZIS OAuth Client

ZIS needs an OAuth client to issue short-lived tokens for managing connections.

1. Go to **Admin Center → Apps and integrations → APIs → OAuth clients**
2. Click **Add OAuth client**
3. Fill in:
   - **Client name:** `tsanet_zis_client`
   - **Description:** TSANet ZIS integration OAuth client
   - **Company:** TSANet
   - **Redirect URLs:** `https://yoursubdomain.zendesk.com` (placeholder — not used)
4. Click **Save** and copy the **Client ID** shown

---

## Step 3 — Create the ZIS Integration

The ZIS integration is a named container for TSANet's connections and flows within Zendesk.

Run this once from your terminal (replace values):

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.zendesk.com/api/services/zis/registry/tsanet_connect" \
  -u "YOUR_EMAIL/token:YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"description": "TSANet Connect integration"}'
```

The integration name (`tsanet_connect`) goes in the **URL path** under `/registry/`; the body carries only the description. A `200 OK` confirms the integration was created.

> If you get a 409 Conflict, the integration already exists — that's fine, proceed to Step 4.

---

## Step 4 — Connect ZIS to TSANet

This is the step the rest of the guide exists to support: registering a connection that lets ZIS flows call the TSANet API. All commands below authenticate with a **ZIS OAuth token** — get one first (uses the Client ID from Step 2):

```bash
ZIS_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST \
  "https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.zendesk.com/api/v2/oauth/tokens" \
  -u "YOUR_EMAIL/token:YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token":{"client_id":"YOUR_ZIS_CLIENT_ID","scopes":["read","write"]}}' | jq -r '.token.full_token')
```

Requires the TSANet-issued Entra client (see Prerequisites). ZIS stores the credential and handles all token minting and renewal itself.

**4a. Register the OAuth client** (the API scope goes in `default_scopes`):
```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.zendesk.com/api/services/zis/connections/oauth/clients/tsanet_connect" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZIS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "tsanet_entra",
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_id": "YOUR_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID",
    "client_secret": "YOUR_ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "token_url": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/TENANT_ID/oauth2/v2.0/token",
    "default_scopes": "api://AUDIENCE/.default"
  }'
```
TSANet provides the `TENANT_ID`, `AUDIENCE`, and your client credentials. Paste the secret **verbatim** — Entra secrets can begin with punctuation, and trimming it breaks auth with `AADSTS7000215`.

**4b. Create the connection** (no browser or admin-consent step):
```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.zendesk.com/api/services/zis/connections/oauth/start/tsanet_connect" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZIS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"oauth_client_name": "tsanet_entra", "name": "tsanet_oauth"}'
```
The response contains a `redirect_url` with a `verification_code`. **GET that URL (with the same `$ZIS_TOKEN` bearer) to complete creation** — required even for client credentials.

**4c. Verify** — the connection should hold a live `access_token` and a `token_expiry` about an hour out:
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZIS_TOKEN" \
  "https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.zendesk.com/api/services/zis/connections/tsanet_connect?name=tsanet_oauth"
```
ZIS renews the token automatically when it expires. Continue to Step 5 to deploy the flow bundle that puts this connection to work.

> Gotcha: to change the stored credential later, the endpoint is **`PATCH`** `/api/services/zis/connections/oauth/clients/tsanet_connect/{uuid}` — `PUT` returns 405.

> An earlier revision of this guide also documented a legacy bearer-token method (a static TSANet JWT kept alive by a scheduled GitHub Actions refresh job). It has been removed to avoid confusion; if you ever need it, it lives in this file's git history.

---

## Step 5 — Deploy the Flow Bundle

The connection from Step 4 does nothing by itself — the flows that create and update Zendesk tickets live in the **flow bundle** under [`zis/`](zis/). Three calls deploy it (full detail, per-instance substitutions, and gotchas in [`zis/README.md`](zis/README.md)):

1. **Upload** [`zis/tsanet_connect_bundle.json`](zis/tsanet_connect_bundle.json) (after substituting your custom field IDs) to `POST /api/services/zis/registry/tsanet_connect/bundles`
2. **Create the inbound webhook** (`source_system: tsanet`, `event_type: collaboration_event`) and keep the returned ingest URL + Basic credentials
3. **Install the job spec** — and re-run this after *every* bundle upload, uploads orphan installs

Also create the **basic-auth `zendesk` connection** the bundle's Zendesk-side actions require (see the README's prerequisites).

> **Inbound push is live.** TSANet → ZIS webhook delivery uses the `callbackAuth` capability ([issue #2](https://github.com/tsanetgit/Zendesk_App/issues/2)), delivered in API **v3.1.0** and validated on Beta (authenticated deliveries return 200 and create tickets). Register the member's webhook subscription with `callbackUrl` = the ingest URL and a `callbackAuth` of type `BASIC` carrying the ingest credentials. You can still exercise the pipeline manually by POSTing a `WebhookPayload`-shaped body to the ingest URL with its Basic credentials.

### Inbound comment forwarding (optional, recommended)

The bundle can also forward an agent's **public reply** to the partner as a TSANet note (issue #34) — so the partner sees agent replies automatically. **Internal** comments are never forwarded; only public replies reach the partner. It needs a second inbound webhook (`source_system: zendesk`, `event_type: public_comment`) plus a Zendesk webhook + trigger. Full setup is in [`zis/README.md` → *Inbound comment forwarding*](zis/README.md).

**If you are not implementing the optional SLA monitor, you are finished here.**

---

## Step 6 — Set GitHub Repository Secrets

> **Steps 6–9 are entirely optional** — they set up the SLA breach alerting described in the intro. Skip them if you don't want it.

In your GitHub repository, add the following secrets via the CLI or the GitHub UI (**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**):

```bash
gh secret set TSANET_USERNAME      --body "api@yourcompany.com"
gh secret set TSANET_PASSWORD      --body "your-tsanet-api-password"
gh secret set ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN    --body "yoursubdomain"
gh secret set ZENDESK_EMAIL        --body "admin@yourcompany.com"
gh secret set ZENDESK_API_TOKEN    --body "your-zendesk-api-token"
gh secret set ZENDESK_FIELD_ID_TOKEN --body "your-tsanet-token-field-id"
```

> `ZENDESK_FIELD_ID_TOKEN` is the Zendesk custom field ID for the **TSANet Token** field — the same value you used in the ZAF app settings (e.g. `1234567890` on the dev instance).

---

## Step 7 — Add the Workflow File

Create `.github/workflows/tsanet-maintenance.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: TSANet SLA Monitor

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0,50 * * * *'   # Every hour at :00 and :50
  workflow_dispatch:           # Allow manual trigger

jobs:
  # ── SLA Breach Monitor ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  sla-monitor:
    name: SLA Breach Monitor
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Get fresh TSANet JWT
        id: tsanet
        run: |
          RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST "https://connect2.tsanet.net/v1/login" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d "{\"username\":\"${{ secrets.TSANET_USERNAME }}\",\"password\":\"${{ secrets.TSANET_PASSWORD }}\"}")
          JWT=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -r '.accessToken')
          if [ -z "$JWT" ] || [ "$JWT" = "null" ]; then
            echo "TSANet login failed: $RESPONSE"
            exit 1
          fi
          echo "::add-mask::$JWT"
          echo "jwt=$JWT" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Check for SLA breaches and tag Zendesk tickets
        env:
          TSANET_JWT: ${{ steps.tsanet.outputs.jwt }}
          ZENDESK_AUTH: ${{ secrets.ZENDESK_EMAIL }}/token:${{ secrets.ZENDESK_API_TOKEN }}
          ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN: ${{ secrets.ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN }}
          FIELD_ID_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ZENDESK_FIELD_ID_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          NOW=$(date -u +%s)
          CASES=$(curl -s \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer $TSANET_JWT" \
            "https://connect2.tsanet.net/v1/collaboration-requests?status=OPEN")

          echo "$CASES" | jq -c '.[]?' | while read -r CASE; do
            TOKEN=$(echo "$CASE" | jq -r '.token // empty')
            RESPOND_BY=$(echo "$CASE" | jq -r '.respondBy // empty')
            [ -z "$TOKEN" ] && continue
            [ -z "$RESPOND_BY" ] && continue

            DEADLINE=$(date -d "$RESPOND_BY" +%s 2>/dev/null \
              || date -j -f "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" "${RESPOND_BY%.*}" +%s 2>/dev/null)
            [ -z "$DEADLINE" ] && continue
            [ "$DEADLINE" -gt "$NOW" ] && continue

            # Find the matching Zendesk ticket
            SEARCH=$(curl -s -u "$ZENDESK_AUTH" \
              "https://${ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN}.zendesk.com/api/v2/search.json?query=custom_field_${FIELD_ID_TOKEN}:${TOKEN}%20type:ticket")
            TICKET_ID=$(echo "$SEARCH" | jq -r '.results[0].id // empty')
            [ -z "$TICKET_ID" ] && echo "No ticket for token ${TOKEN:0:8}..." && continue

            # Skip if already tagged (prevents repeat notifications)
            TAGS=$(echo "$SEARCH" | jq -r '.results[0].tags // [] | join(" ")')
            if echo "$TAGS" | grep -q "tsanet_sla_breached"; then
              echo "Ticket #$TICKET_ID already tagged — skipping"
              continue
            fi

            # Tag the ticket — fires the Zendesk SLA breach trigger
            TAG_STATUS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
              -X POST -u "$ZENDESK_AUTH" \
              -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
              "https://${ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN}.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/${TICKET_ID}/tags.json" \
              -d '{"tags":["tsanet_sla_breached"]}')
            echo "Tagged ticket #$TICKET_ID (HTTP $TAG_STATUS)"
          done
```

> **Production vs Beta:** The workflow above uses `connect2.tsanet.net` (Beta). For production, change both `tsanet.net` references to `tsanet.org`.

---

## Step 8 — Push and Verify

```bash
git add .github/workflows/tsanet-maintenance.yml
git commit -m "Add TSANet SLA monitor workflow"
git push
```

> If the push is rejected with a `workflow` scope error, run: `gh auth refresh -s workflow`

Then verify:
1. Go to your repo → **Actions** tab
2. Find **TSANet SLA Monitor** → click **Run workflow** to trigger manually
3. The job should complete green within ~30 seconds
4. Confirm the ZIS connection is active by calling the ZIS API directly:
   ```bash
   curl -s -u "YOUR_EMAIL/token:YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
     "https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.zendesk.com/api/services/zis/integrations/tsanet_connect/connections"
   ```
   You should see the `tsanet_oauth` connection in the response. Note: ZIS custom integrations do **not** appear in Admin Center UI (Apps and integrations → Integrations) — that page only shows marketplace integrations. The API is the only way to verify.

---

## Step 9 — Create the SLA Breach Trigger in Zendesk (optional — pairs with sla-monitor)

If you haven't done this as part of the ZAF setup:

1. Go to **Admin Center → Objects and rules → Business rules → Triggers**
2. Create a trigger named `TSANet SLA Breach — Notify Assignee`
3. Conditions:
   - `Update type` | `is` | `Changed`
   - `Current tags` | `includes` | `tsanet_sla_breached`
4. Action: `Notify user` → `(Assignee)` with appropriate subject and body
5. Save

This fires exactly once per breach (the tag is only added once — subsequent runs skip already-tagged tickets).

---

## How It All Fits Together

```
TSANet API                    Zendesk
──────────────────────────    ─────────────────────────────────────
Entra tokens (~60 min)   ←── ZIS OAuth connection "tsanet_oauth"
                              mints and renews tokens itself —
                              nothing scheduled, no refresh job

Optional:
OPEN cases list          ←── GitHub Actions sla-monitor job
                              (runs at :00 and :50 every hour)
                              Finds overdue cases → tags tickets
                              → Zendesk trigger → email to assignee
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `sla-monitor` job finds no tickets for breached cases | Check that `ZENDESK_FIELD_ID_TOKEN` matches the TSANet Token field ID used by the ZAF app |
| Trigger fires repeatedly for same ticket | Confirm the trigger condition uses `current_tags` (not `tags`) — wrong field name causes the check to fail silently |
| `gh auth refresh -s workflow` required | GitHub OAuth token was issued without the `workflow` scope — this is a one-time fix |
| ZIS reports `AADSTS7000215` (invalid client secret) but the same secret works elsewhere | The stored value is corrupted (paste artifact, trimmed leading punctuation) — re-send it verbatim via `PATCH /api/services/zis/connections/oauth/clients/tsanet_connect/{uuid}` |
| Updating the OAuth client returns 405 | Use `PATCH`, not `PUT`, on the client endpoint |
| Connection created but no `access_token` | The `verification_code` exchange step was skipped — GET the `redirect_url` from the start response with the ZIS bearer |

---

## Key Concepts

**How does ZIS authenticate to TSANet?**  
The ZIS OAuth connection stores your TSANet-issued Entra client credential and exchanges it for short-lived access tokens via the client credentials grant. ZIS renews expired tokens automatically, so every ZIS flow that calls the TSANet API gets a valid token without handling any authentication logic itself.

**Why GitHub Actions for the SLA monitor and not ZIS flows?**  
ZIS flows are event-driven (triggered by Zendesk events like ticket updates). The SLA poll doesn't fit that model — it needs to run on a time schedule regardless of ticket activity. GitHub Actions scheduled workflows are the simplest and most reliable mechanism for this.

**Why is the SLA scope only OPEN cases?**  
TSANet SLA is acknowledgment-only. Once a case is Accepted, Rejected, or Info Requested (`responded: true`), TSANet stops tracking it. Checking ACCEPTED/CLOSED cases for SLA breaches would produce false positives.

**How does a support agent send a partner-only note (no ZAF app)?**  
A partner-only note reaches the TSANet partner but stays hidden from the end customer. The agent:

1. Types the note in the **TSANet Action Text** field.
2. Sets **TSANet Action** to **Add Note** — or applies the one-click **`TSANet: Send partner-only note`** macro (admins create this macro once; it sets the dropdown for the agent).
3. Submits the ticket.

The flow posts the note to the partner (`POST /notes`) with **no** public comment, and adds an **internal** receipt comment (prefixed `[TSANet note sent to partner (partner-only)]`, carrying a `tsanet-note-id` marker) so there is a Zendesk record whether or not the ZAF app is installed. This is the native equivalent of the ZAF app's "Partner only" tier ([#56](https://github.com/tsanetgit/Zendesk_App/issues/56)); full detail and the macro-creation command are in [`zis/README.md`](zis/README.md). **Important:** Zendesk's native composer toggle is only *Public reply* / *Internal note* and **cannot be extended**, so partner-only must come from the TSANet Action field or the **`TSANet: Send partner-only note`** macro, never the native reply menu.

**What lands on an inbound ticket?**  
The created ticket carries the TSANet token, status, and partner company, plus — when the collaboration includes submitter contact — a `Submitter: Name <email>` line in the description and opening comment ([#57](https://github.com/tsanetgit/Zendesk_App/issues/57)), so the partner engineer who opened the case is visible without opening the sidebar.

---

## Important Limitations

**ZIS scheduled polling is retired**  
An earlier design included a ZIS flow (`flow_poll_tsanet`) intended to poll TSANet for inbound cases on a schedule. This never functioned due to three layered failures (clock ticket required `new` status, no `requestToken` in automation payload, JWT expiry during execution). The flow remains installed but is permanently dormant — both Zendesk automations that triggered it have been disabled. Inbound case sync is now handled by:
- **ZIS push delivery (primary)** — TSANet POSTs each event to the ZIS ingest webhook, secured by `callbackAuth` (see below)
- **ZAF background poller (fallback)** — runs every 1 minute while any agent has Zendesk open; defers to push and only backfills a ticket push didn't already create
- **GitHub Actions `sla-monitor`** — server-side SLA breach detection regardless of browser state

**ZIS inbound webhook — resolved (push is live)**  
This was previously blocked: ZIS inbound webhook flows require an `Authorization` header on every POST, but TSANet's webhook system sent only an HMAC-SHA256 signature, so direct delivery returned 401. TSANet added the `callbackAuth` capability to its webhook registration API (delivered in Connect API **v3.1.0**), which closes the gap — [issue #2](https://github.com/tsanetgit/Zendesk_App/issues/2) is closed. Register the member's webhook subscription with a `callbackAuth` of type `BASIC` carrying the ingest credentials; TSANet then attaches Basic Auth on every delivery alongside the HMAC signature, and ZIS accepts the authenticated request. Validated end to end on Beta (deliveries return 200 and create exactly one ticket per case).

**Zendesk Views API cannot set custom field columns**  
If you create or modify a Zendesk view via the API and include `custom_field_XXXXXXX` column IDs in `execution.columns`, the API accepts the request without error but silently reverts to the original columns. Custom field columns on views must be configured manually in **Admin Center → Workspaces → Views**.
