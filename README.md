<b>For maintainers — source of truth:</b>

This repository is the canonical source for the ZAF app. The deployed bundle under [`zaf-build/`](zaf-build/) is edited directly (no transpile/build step) and packaged with [`scripts/package.sh`](scripts/package.sh). Pushing a `v*` tag builds the installable zip and attaches it to a GitHub Release automatically. See [`zaf-build/README.md`](zaf-build/README.md) for the full edit-and-package loop. The old Vite source repo is archived and must not be used.
