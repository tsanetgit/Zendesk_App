# TSANet Connect — ZAF App Quick Start Guide

**App version:** v1.0.29  
**Last updated:** May 2026  
**Time to complete:** ~30 minutes

This guide gets the TSANet Connect sidebar app installed and working in your Zendesk instance. When done, agents will see all active TSANet collaboration cases directly on every ticket.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| Zendesk Admin access | You need Apps & Integrations → Private Apps permission |
| TSANet API credentials | Email membership@tsanet.org to request a dedicated API user |
| TSANet environment | BETA (`connect2.tsanet.net`) or PRODUCTION (`connect2.tsanet.org`) |
| App ZIP file | `tsanet-connect-v1.0.29.zip` |

---

## Step 1 — Create the Zendesk Custom Fields

The app uses four custom ticket fields to store TSANet data. Create each one in **Admin Center → Objects and rules → Tickets → Fields**.

| Field Label | Type | Note |
|---|---|---|
| TSANet Token | Text | Primary key — links ticket to TSANet case |
| TSANet Status | Dropdown | Values: `tsanet_status_open`, `tsanet_status_accepted`, `tsanet_status_information`, `tsanet_status_rejected`, `tsanet_status_closed` |
| TSANet Partner | Text | Stores the partner company name |
| TSANet Respond By | Date | SLA acknowledgment deadline (auto-cleared on acknowledgment) |

**After creating each field, note its Field ID** (shown in the URL when you click the field, e.g. `48849323029652`). You'll need all four IDs in Step 3.

> **Optional:** Create a fifth field **TSANet Tokens Multi** (Text) if you need to store multiple token references on a single ticket. Add its ID to the `field_id_tokens_multi` setting.

---

## Step 2 — Install the App

1. Go to **Admin Center → Apps and Integrations → Zendesk Support Apps**
2. Click **Upload private app** (top-right)
3. Give it a name: `TSANet Connect`
4. Upload `tsanet-connect-v1.0.29.zip`
5. Click **Upload**

Zendesk will validate the package and show the installation settings screen.

---

## Step 3 — Configure App Settings

Fill in the settings on the installation screen:

| Setting | Value | Required |
|---|---|---|
| **TSANet API username** | Your TSANet API user email (e.g. `api@yourcompany.com`) | ✅ |
| **TSANet API password** | TSANet API user password | ✅ |
| **TSANet environment** | `BETA` or `PRODUCTION` | ✅ |
| **Zendesk Field ID for TSANet Token** | Field ID from Step 1 | ✅ |
| **Zendesk Field ID for TSANet Tokens Multi** | Field ID from Step 1 (optional) | ❌ |
| **Zendesk Field ID for TSANet Status** | Field ID from Step 1 | ✅ |
| **Zendesk Field ID for TSANet Partner** | Field ID from Step 1 | ✅ |
| **Zendesk Field ID for TSANet Respond By** | Field ID from Step 1 | ✅ |

Click **Install**.

## Step 4 — Verify the Installation

1. Open a Zendesk ticket that has **no TSANet collaboration** associated with it
2. The **TSANet Connect** panel should appear collapsed to a slim bar (~44px) with the text **"No active TSANet cases"** and a **+ New** button
3. Click **+ New** — the panel should expand to full height and open the New Collaboration search dialog
4. Search for a known TSANet member to confirm the form loads and partner lookup works

Now open a ticket that **does** have a TSANet token set in the TSANet Token field:
5. The panel should expand automatically to full height and display the TSANet case details

> If the sidebar shows an error instead of the compact bar, double-check that your TSANet API credentials are correct and that the TSANet environment setting matches where your account is provisioned (BETA vs PRODUCTION).

---

## Step 5 — Create the SLA Breach Trigger (Recommended)

This Zendesk trigger emails the ticket assignee the moment an SLA breach is detected.

1. Go to **Admin Center → Objects and rules → Business rules → Triggers**
2. Click **Add trigger** and name it: `TSANet SLA Breach — Notify Assignee`
3. Set **Meet ALL of the following conditions:**
   - `Update type` | `is` | `Changed`
   - `Current tags` | `includes` | `tsanet_sla_breached`
4. Set the **Action:**
   - `Notify user` → `(Assignee)`
   - Subject: `⚠️ TSANet SLA Breached — Action Required`
   - Body:
     ```
     A TSANet collaboration request on ticket {{ticket.title}} ({{ticket.url}}) 
     has breached its acknowledgment SLA deadline.

     Please open the TSANet Connect panel and Accept, Reject, or Request More Info 
     immediately to acknowledge the case.
     ```
5. Click **Create**

## What the App Does

The sidebar panel adapts based on whether the current ticket is linked to a TSANet collaboration:

**On tickets with no TSANet case (compact mode):**
- Collapses to a slim 44px bar: "No active TSANet cases · + New"
- Clicking **+ New** expands the panel and opens the New Collaboration dialog
- Keeps the sidebar tidy and unobtrusive for regular support tickets

**On tickets with a TSANet case (full panel):**
- **All active TSANet collaborations** linked to that ticket
- **Case status** — OPEN, INFORMATION, ACCEPTED, REJECTED, CLOSED
- **SLA countdown** — color-coded timer on OPEN (unacknowledged) cases only
  - 🟢 Green: more than 1 hour remaining
  - 🟡 Amber: 30–60 minutes remaining
  - 🔴 Red: under 30 minutes remaining
  - ⚠️ BREACHED: deadline passed
- **Partner engineer contact details** (once accepted)
- **Action buttons:** Accept, Reject, Request Info, Respond, Add Note (Subject + Details fields), Close (outbound only)

**Background behavior (always active while Zendesk is open):**
- Polls TSANet every 5 minutes for new inbound collaboration requests and auto-creates Zendesk tickets
- Checks for SLA breaches and adds the `tsanet_sla_breached` tag to overdue tickets, firing the email trigger
- Mirrors TSANet collaboration notes to the Zendesk ticket thread as **internal comments** — agents can read partner communication directly in the ticket without opening the sidebar

> **SLA scope:** The countdown and breach alerting only apply to the **initial acknowledgment** deadline. Once a case is Accepted, Rejected, or Info Requested, TSANet stops tracking the SLA and the countdown disappears.

## Updating the App

Zendesk does not support API-based app binary updates. To update:

1. Go to **Admin Center → Apps and Integrations → Zendesk Support Apps**
2. Click the **TSANet Connect** app → **Update**
3. Upload the new ZIP file
4. Settings are preserved between updates — no need to re-enter credentials

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Sidebar shows "Credentials not configured" | Re-check TSANet username and password in app settings |
| Accept button returns "Error processing request" | Verify `tsanet_username` matches the domain registered with TSANet (e.g. `api@yourcompany.com`, not an agent's personal email) |
| New Collaboration search returns no results | Partner may not be in TSANet; check connect.tsanet.org for their membership |
| SLA countdown missing on OPEN case | `respondBy` field may be null — TSANet sets it based on your group SLA configuration |
| Background poller not creating tickets | Check browser console (`[TSANet BG]` log prefix); ensure credentials are set and TSANet has INBOUND cases |

---

## Field ID Reference (TSANet Dev Instance — `d3v-tsanet.zendesk.com`)

> **For reference only** — these IDs are specific to TSANet's internal dev instance. Your Zendesk account will have entirely different IDs. As of v1.0.29 the install dialog ships with empty defaults so you cannot accidentally inherit these values; you must enter your own.

| Field | TSANet Dev ID (do not copy) |
|---|---|
| TSANet Token | `48849323029652` |
| TSANet Tokens Multi | `48849323042964` |
| TSANet Status | `48849333960724` |
| TSANet Partner | `48849315296660` |
| TSANet Respond By | `48849323088276` |
